                <h2>To My Mother</h2>
                <p>
                Dearly I yearn for my mother’s bread,
My mother’s coffee,<br>
Mother’s brushing touch.<br>
Childhood is raised in me,<br>
Day upon day in me.<br>
And I so cherish life<br>
Because if I died<br>
My mother’s tears would shame me.<br>
Set me, if I return one day,<br>
As a shawl on your eyelashes, let your hand<br>
Spread grass out over my bones,<br>
Christened by your immaculate footsteps<br>
As on holy land.<br>
Fasten us with a lock of hair,<br>
With thread strung from the back of your dress.<br>
I could grow into godhood<br>
Commend my spirit into godhood<br>
If I but touch your heart’s deep breadth.<br>
<br>
Set me, if ever I return,<br>
In your oven as fuel to help you cook,<br>
On your roof as a clothesline stretched in your hands.<br>
Weak without your daily prayers,<br>
I can no longer stand.<br>
<br>
I am old<br>
Give me back the stars of childhood<br>
That I may chart the homeward quest<br>
Back with the migrant birds,<br>
Back to your awaiting nest.<br>

                <h2>Guido Fubini</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied under the notable mathematicians Ulisse
                    Dini and Luigi Bianchi. He gained some early fame when his 1900 doctoral thesis, entitled Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces, was discussed in a widely read work on differential geometry published by Bianchi in 1902.

                <p>
                    Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin (also spelled Lusin;   9 December 1883 – 28 January 1950) was a Soviet/Russian mathematician known for his work in descriptive set theory and aspects of mathematical analysis with strong connections to point-set topology. He was
                    the eponym of Luzitania, a loose group of young Moscow mathematicians of the first half of the 1920s. They adopted his set-theoretic orientation, and went on to apply it in other areas of mathematics.
